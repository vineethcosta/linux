# Assignment 1: Finding out what the VM-x features are.

This assignment basically deals with the functionality involved in determining what are the features available in a CPU.

Steps involved:
1) Clone the repo https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
2) Navigate into the linux folder
3) Create folder name CMPE283 and copy Makefile
4) Execute the command make all inside that folder directory
5) We can unload and load the modules using :
sudo rmmod ./cmpe283.ko
sudo insmod ./cmpe283.ko
6) Use dmesg to log the VMX features in the Kernel log


# Assignment 2: 
Make the linux kernel environment ready by cloning the git and executing the commands below:
1) cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
2) make oldconfig
3) make -j 8 modules_install
4) make install

After this, we need to run ubuntu inside Inner VM. 


After making relevant changes to cpuid.c and vmx.c, compile the kernel using the commands below

a) make -j 8 modules
b) make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
c) rmmod kvm_intel
d) rmmod kvm
e) modprobe kvm
f) modprobe kvm_intel

After staring Inner vm, we run the test file to check the output.
