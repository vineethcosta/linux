# Assignment 1: Finding out what the VM-x features are.

This assignment basically deals with the functionality involved in determining what are the features available in a CPU.

Steps involved:
1) Clone the repo https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git
2) Navigate into the linux folder
3) Create folder name CMPE283 and copy Makefile
4) Execute the command make all inside that folder directory
5) We can unload and load the modules using :
sudo rmmod ./cmpe283.ko
sudo insmod ./cmpe283.ko
6) Use dmesg to log the VMX features in the Kernel log


# Assignment 2: 

Make the linux kernel environment ready by cloning the git and executing the commands below:
1) cp /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
2) make oldconfig
3) make -j 8 modules_install
4) make install

After this, we need to run ubuntu inside Inner VM. 


After making relevant changes to cpuid.c and vmx.c, compile the kernel using the commands below

a) make -j 8 modules
b) make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
c) rmmod kvm_intel
d) rmmod kvm
e) modprobe kvm
f) modprobe kvm_intel

After staring Inner vm, we run the test file to check the output.

# Assignment 3

Vineeth Reddy Pati (015227810)

The inbuilt configuration of assignment 1 has been used and code changes have been made on top of it.

Steps followed to acheive assignment 3:
I collected all the exit reasons possible that can be configured and configured it to the KVM. For the EAX value 0x4FFFFFFD and 0x4FFFFFFC, I have made changes in the vmx.c and cpuid.c files.
After doing so, I have compiled the Kernel using the following steps:

a) make -j 8 modules
b) make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install
c) lsmod | grep kvm
d) rmmod kvm_intel
e) rmmod kvm
f) lsmod | grep kvm
g) modprobe kvm
h) modprobe kvm_intel
i) lsmod | grep kvm


Started the inner Virtual Machine.


Answers for Questions:

3) Exit count values which are greater than 0 were majorly observed for 0, 28, 30, 40, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 54. For the exit codes 0, 30, 45, 48, the count increased to a very high value during reboot, but increased with a lower
value during deletion and creation of file operations. For exit codes  28, 46, 47, 54, the count only increased during reboot by a stable rate.

4) Least frequent exit types: 46, 47 and 54
   Most frequent exit types:  0, 28, 30 and 48

Steps followed:

After running the 0x4FFFFFFD by enabling the nested paging, we see the exit count for each exit reason.After that, I removed kvm_intel using 'rmmod kvm_intel' and reloaded it
by setting the ept value to 0(forcing to enable shadow paging). Now we can get the total exit counts from outer VM using dmesg command.Now we have total count if nested paging is enabled and shadow paging enabled.

Here are some of the sample output prints from with and without ept exit count outputs:

With nested paging enabled, the exit count for exit reason 30 is less:
https://github.com/vineethcosta/linux/blob/master/exitcountless30-nestedpaging.png

With shadow paging enabled, the exit count for exit reason 30 is more:
https://github.com/vineethcosta/linux/blob/master/exitcounthigh30-shadowpaging.png

This shows significant increase in exit count when shadow paging is enabled( one of the sample examples)


Answers:
3) The number of exits for shadow paging are quite huge when compared to nested paging. This might occur because in shadow paging, data is fragmented and shattered and concurrent operations
are also hard to execute.THus its architecture itself requires more additional exits to function as a VMM. This is expected behaviour from shadow paging)

4) For the exit reason 30, we observe that there is a significant rise of exits when nested paging is disabled (Attached screenshots). We can also observe other exit counts to considerably rise when shadow paging is forcibly enabled when compared to nested paging
